# Tempest

Tempest is a message processing framework for writing topologies, written in Rust, and inspired by Apache Storm (hence the name).

## Motivation

- Take high-level Apache Storm concepts and port them to Rust.
- Use Redis Streams as a source

# Notes

- This is the initial draft. More details to come later.
